# Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, the news industry has grown exponentially, generating a massive amount of data every day. With the increasing availability of online news sources, it has become crucial to classify news articles into different categories for efficient retrieval and analysis. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify news headlines into one of several pre-defined categories. The dataset used in this project consists of news headlines from various online news portals, with each headline labeled into one of the following categories: national, international, business & economy, sports, and health. The proposed model should be able to take in a new news headline as input and predict its appropriate category accurately. The model's accuracy and performance will be evaluated based on accuracy. This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in classifying news articles and their potential for improving the news industry's efficiency and productivity. Construct a ML model to classify news headlines into categories like national, international, business, sports, and health. Evaluate its accuracy to demonstrate its efficiency in analyzing news data.
